# Nexus-Auto-Download ‚öôÔ∏è‚ö°
Simple script that clicks the download button when installing mods on Nexus without premium. Really helpful when using Wabbajack. üëç
It detects the photo 'nexus.png' in the same directory as the script, and then moves the mouse to it and clicks.

The key to stop the program is '#' by default but can be easily changed.
You can also configure the photo it detects by changing the name it looks for in the script and replacing the photo.

To start the program just have python installed, install the dependencies via install-dependencies.py (if you don't have them) and then run main.py
