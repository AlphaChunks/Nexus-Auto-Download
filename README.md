# Nexus-Auto-Download ⚙️⚡
Simple script that clicks the download button when installing mods on Nexus without premium. Really helpful when using Wabbajack. 👍
It detects the photo 'nexus.png' in the same directory as the script, and then moves the mouse to it and clicks.

The key to stop the program is '#' by default but can be easily changed.
You can also configure the photo it detects by changing the name it looks for in the script and replacing the photo.
